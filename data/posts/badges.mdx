summary: An update on the site, and a new feature to help you understand which model is being used.

I started this site early 2023, ChatGPT was the new hot thing and we didn't even have an API.

So as I started building out this site, I used the 'latest' tech aka GPT-3 with decent result.

Looking back now we've had a crazy few months...

- ChatGPT API
- GPT-4
- ChatGPT Plus
- ChatGPT Plugin annoucements
- AutoGPTs

The eagle eyed amongst you, hopefully have noticed this site is now living at [aiexperiments.co](https://aiexperiments.co), and I'm taking my AI education, building tools and this site a little more seriously.

To help understand the experiments, I've added badges to clearly show which model they are using:

- <GPT3Badge />
- <ChatGPTBadge />
- <GPT4Badge />

They kinda represent a traffic light system, with my plan to upgrade / rework experiments to use the latest models.

As always I'd love your feedback, how can I make this site better? What experiments would you like to see? is it useful? Drop me an email at ai@mattspear.co

Thanks,<br></br>
Matt
