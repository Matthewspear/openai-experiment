ðŸ‘‹ I'm a tad obsessive with courses, and learning materials (see my previous project [Learnso](https://learnso.co)) - my current goal is to skill up around Large Language Models (LLMs) and keep in the loop with new AI developments.

AI Experiments is my platform to apply and practice what I learn.

Recently, while having a conversation with [Simon](https://twitter.com/simonda1ey) from [Hacker Cabin](https://hackercabin.com/), I realized I've been accumulated a list of favorite resources for learning AI. I thought it'd be great to share them here. I'd love to hear about your learning journey as well!

## My Top Resources

Here are my top resources I've found so far:
