                Matt Spear

              . I&apos;m a freelance software engineer and for the last decade
              I&apos;ve been facinated with technology, building with it and
              learning from it.
            </p>
            <p>
              Since learning to program AI, Deep Learning, ML has always been an
              illusive interest. I&apos;ve spent time in the AR space, on SLAM
              systems and working with CoreML, Apple&apos;s ML framework. But{" "}

              </a>{" "}
              and the &quot;Deep Learning for Coders&quot; course was my first
              real introduction to everyday coders working on cutting edge ML.
              Jeremy Howard is a legend and who doesn&apos;t love the tagline
              &quot;Making neural nets uncool again&quot;.
            </p>
            <p>
              The good news is I still feel like a beginner and this site is a
              result of wanting to learn, share and try something new. I&apos;m
              eagar to build a SaaS business / App / Startup and I want to take
              you with me along the way! In the coming weeks I plan on starting
              a YouTube channel and creating some video content and building out
              usecases, tutorials and examples.
            </p>

              Thanks,
