Welcome to AI Experiments â€“ a place for me to share my experiments with AI tooling and learnings from my journey.

I'd like to introduce myself, Matt Spear, a software engineer with a passion for learning and building. I've been working as a freelance iOS developer for 5-6 years, and have worked on a variety of projects, from building a mindful social network for gamers to building a platform for managing and deploying microservices.

I've been interested in AI for a while, and have been experimenting with it for a few years now. I've built a few chatbots, and have been experimenting with GPT-3. I've also been experimenting with other AI tooling, such as OpenAI's Dall-E, and have been learning about the theory behind it.

I've been wanting to build a place to share my experiments and learnings, and this is it. I hope you enjoy it, and I'd love to hear your feedback.

Feel free to check out the code over at [GitHub](https://github.com/matthewspear/openai-experiment).

The plan is to write a few articles a week, and I'll be sharing my experiments on Twitter.

Check out the existing experiment that are live [/experiments](/experiments) and vote on upcoming experiements.

There might be youtube videos / streams in the future, but for now, I'll be writing articles and building out usecases.

Thanks for reading, and I hope you enjoy the site.

Matt
